This app allows anyone to search events but to edit, delete or add new event the user must be logged in, Users can also login/register.
I have used a very basic authentication system which logsout on refresh as i haven't saved the state to local storage as this may be out of scope according to problem statement. I have used bootstrap of responsive ui. For backend testing I have used json-server and json-server-auth for saving auth details as middleware to json-server.
